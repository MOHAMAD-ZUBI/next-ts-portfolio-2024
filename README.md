# Next.js Portfolio

This is a portfolio project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamad-zubi/next-ts-portfolio-2024.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd next-ts-portfolio-2024
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Customization

You can customize the portfolio by modifying the `app/page.tsx` and the `src/ConstantData.js` files. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

## Font Optimization

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
